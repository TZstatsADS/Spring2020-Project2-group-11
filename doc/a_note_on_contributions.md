Project Emergency Response of FDNY

Team members: Rui Wang, Daniel Schmidle, Huize Huang, Ivan Wolansky, Jiawei Liu

Summary: In this project, we developed an app about all the emergency reports related to FDNY, constructing a map to clearly visualize the emergency locations. Our main target audience is the FDNY.This app can help them easily understand the overall situations in NYC, making rational allocation of resources. It will be meaningful if they deploy more firehouses within the area of higher emergency frequencies in the city. What's more, New York citizens are also encouraged to check our app when considering the safety factors of their
future houses.

[Contribution Statement] All team members discussed and decided the theme for our app. Ivan did the geomapping of longitude and latitude data, and then developed the interactive heat map. Rui developed the ‘Alarm Classification’ model and added additional interaction with the interactive pie chart on the map, and also prepared for the presentation. Daniel explored all the data set and developed the ‘Analysis’ part. Huize explored all the data set and developed the ‘Personalized Analysis’ part. Jiawei developed the layout of the whole app and wrote the ‘Info’ page. Rui, Huize and Jiawei integrated all the codes of our app. Rui made some improvements on the layout. Huize and Jiawei contributed to the README file. All team members contributed to the publish and deploy process of our app. (To successfully deploy our app, we upgraded the account.)
