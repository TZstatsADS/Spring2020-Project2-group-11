# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Note: For our Fire project, we did not include the csv of the Fire Incident Dispatch Data due to size. However, this dataset can be found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Fire-Incident-Dispatch-Data/8m42-w767.
